Type of users in Django:
1. Built-in User -> class User(AbstractUser)
2. Use User only for auth and define Profile model for user data
3. Overwrite User by inherit AbstractBaseUser for auth and define Profile model for user data

Best option is to use 3 since it provides full and comprehensive creation of the user class and it wont be difficult to
alter this class later on

In settings.py we need to point AUTH_BASE_USER = 'app.user'
